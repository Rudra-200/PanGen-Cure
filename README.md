# ⚕️PanGen Cure: Generative AI for Pancreatic Cancer Detection & Automated Report Generation.

## 🚀 Overview
This project integrates **Large Language Models(LLMs), multi-modal AI, and Generative AI (GenAI)** to enhance **pancreatic cancer detection** by analyzing **CT scan images and Urinary biomarker data of Patient**. The system employs **A RAG-based LLM (IBM Granite 3.2 or BioGPT)** for generating **detailed diagnostic reports** and provides **real-time surgical guidance** to improve clinical decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Improve early detection** of pancreatic cancer by combining **medical imaging and biochemical analysis**.
- **Reduce misdiagnosis rates** with a **fusion AI model**.
- **Generate detailed, interpretable reports** for oncologists using **BioGPT** or **IBM Granite 3.2**.
- **Support surgical planning** with **AI-guided 3D tumor localization**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, CNN (ResNet, EfficientNet), Pycaret Pipeline
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** BioGPT/IBM Granite 3.2-3b , Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Data Processing:** OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy
- **Medical Imaging:** DICOM, NIFTI, MONAI
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## 🔬 Methodology
1. **CT Scan Image Analysis:** CNN-based deep learning models detect tumor presence and segmentation.
2. **Urinary Biomarker Analysis:** MLP processes structured lab test data for biochemical patterns.
3. **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Attention-based fusion network integrates imaging and lab data.
4. **LLM Integration:** Generates detailed diagnostic reports based on model predictions.
5. **Surgical Assistance:** AI-based 3D modeling for tumor localization and surgical planning.(A Future Upgrade)

## 📌 Features
✅ **Automated cancer detection** from CT scans and lab reports  
✅ **Multi-modal fusion AI** for enhanced diagnostic accuracy  
✅ **GenAI-generated diagnostic reports** for oncologists  
✅ **Surgical guidance system** for tumor localization  
✅ **Scalable and adaptable for clinical deployment**  

## 📈 Expected Impact
- **Higher diagnostic accuracy** (12-15% improvement over single-modal methods)
- **Faster and more reliable detection**, reducing misdiagnosis
- **Improved access to cancer care**, especially in underserved regions
- **Clinical adoption potential** in hospitals, research ceners, and biotech firms
